# Overview:
#### 

One of the key stakeholders would like to see a bike trip analysis.

For this analysis, weâ€™ll create a set of visualizations to:

Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week

# Results:

## Most rides are under 20 minutes

## Unknown gender rides are longer

## Weekday mornings and evenings are busiest

## Bike repairs are necessary for the most used bikes, hovering on each cells will display bikeID

# Summary:

From the visualsations it's clear that busiest hours are weekday mornings and evenings. The busiest group are male subscribers. Most rides are less than 20 minutes.

Suggested visualisations: 
- trips by starting locations to see when locations are busy in the morning/evening
- trips by ending locations to see when locations are busy in the morning/evening
